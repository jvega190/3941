Site with all of our current controls to test [#3941](https://github.com/craftercms/craftercms/issues/3941)

Homepage has all of the controls with some changes for the history to populate.

- When comparing the 2 most recent history entries we will see all of the controls with changes
- To see the diff between no content set and content set, we can compare the first history entry (oldest) with the most recent one.

There another page called 'page'. That one only has a repeating group (no other controls)
